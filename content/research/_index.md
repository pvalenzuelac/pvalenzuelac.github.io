    This paper studies the consequences of displacement resulting from the construction of the Interstate Highway System in the United States. It starts by showing that highway placement within urban areas was not random. Exploiting cross-sectional variation between neighborhoods in 1950, the last census before the 1956 Federal-Aid Highway Act, I show that tracts with a higher proportion of the city's Black population were more prone to receive a highway, even after controlling for socio-demographic and geographic characteristics of the tract.  Subsequently, the paper examines the impact on affected individuals. By geocoding the full-count 1940 census and linking it to administrative mortality records, I track affected individuals before and after highway construction. Exploiting the quasi-random variation in close proximity to highway developments, I show that displaced individuals die at a younger age, exhibit a higher likelihood of relocating from their neighborhood, and lived in neighborhoods with lower socioeconomic characteristics at their time of death. Moreover, although more nuanced, individuals residing near a highway are negatively impacted. These effects show up in the aggregate. By running an event study design for neighborhoods between 1930 and 2020, I found that highway construction is associated with out-migration, explained by a decrease in the Black population.

  We analyze the formation of immigrant enclaves in Canada. We develop a quantitative model of internal city structure in which forward-looking individuals choose where to live and work at every period. We allow for heterogeneous preferences over endogenous amenities depending on immigration status. We exploit Canadian administrative tax files and estimate group-specific neighborhood valuation using a revealed preference approach. By exploiting the neighborhood-to-neighborhood transition of households in Canada, we document that the correlation of neighborhood valuations between foreign- and Canadian-born households is positive but far from unity. We then analyze counterfactual scenarios where households have the same preferences regardless of nationality and study the implications for income and urban segregation.

    This paper examines the long-run socioeconomic impact of highway construction on U.S. neighborhoods.
    I construct a balanced panel of neighborhood-level characteristics from 1930 to 2020 for 62 metropolitan areas by combining data from historical census records and decennial censuses.
    Neighborhood-level aggregates for 1930 and 1940 are created by geocoding address-level information from historical files and then aggregating the data to match census tract boundaries.
    Using a matched difference-in-differences design, I find that highway construction reduces the total population of neighborhoods.
    The effects are driven by a relative decline in the Black population, with no significant effect on the white population.
    There is no evidence of changes in rents, but homeownership rates decrease following highway construction.
    The analysis suggests that these effects are more pronounced in suburban areas and in neighborhoods with a low initial share of Black residents.
    Additionally, I find evidence of spillover effects on adjacent neighborhoods.

- **Does the College Bias of Agglomeration Externalities Vary Across the Work-Cycle and Time?**

  This paper documents the heterogeneous rise in the urban gradient of the college wage gap across workers of different ages between 1980 and 2019. Using immigrants' enclaves from 1970 as source of identification, I find that the young workers have traditionally had a steeper relationship between college wage gap and city population than old workers. Also, I find that the evolution of this urban gradient of the college wage gap has been larger for younger workers. These findings are not caused by sorting in unobserved characteristics, by outliers in the wage distribution, or by compositional changes. I show that the source of the increase in the urban component of the college wage gap is a shift in the occupational structure across the work-cycle and cities. While old and young college workers have shifted away from highly-routinary-low-paying jobs, specially in more populated cities, young high school graduates’ occupational structure has remained unaltered since 1980.

## Book Chapters 
- **Una Restricción Vehicular Inteligente para la Congestión y Contaminación de Santiago**
  <br /> with JP Montero, L. Basso, F. Sepúlveda, L. Cifuentes, and S. Vicuña. In Spanish.

  <div class="details" id="show4">
    Ante los persistentes problemas de congestión y contaminación en la ciudad de Santiago, avanzamos en una propuesta de política pública de restricción vehicular que se construye a partir de iniciativas impulsadas en el pasado por el Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y el Ministerio de Transporte y Telecomunicaciones. Se trata de un diseño “inteligente”, porque: (i) lleva a un aumento importante (aunque menor que el máximo posible) de bienestar en la población, tanto por reducciones en tiempos de viaje como de contaminantes locales y globales; (ii) incluye medidas para distribuir los beneficios de la política en forma más equitativa entre los distintos grupos de ingreso; y (iii) tiene factibilidad política de implementación, ya que comparte elementos de propuestas existentes o bajo consideración. Nuestra propuesta base incluye una restricción de dos días a la semana (cuatro dígitos diarios) durante horas punta, con una opción de eximición, previo pago de un pase diario que depende del tipo de vehículo y época del año. De octubre a marzo, el pase diario estaría disponible a todo vehículo a un precio de $9.000. De abril a septiembre, el pase diario estaría disponible solo para vehículos que cumplan con la normativa de emisión Euro III. El total de la recaudación de los pases diarios se destina al transporte público, ya sea para mejorar su servicio (aumentos de frecuencia) y/o reducir sus tarifas. En caso que el 100% de la recaudación se destine a esto último, las tarifas caerían en 35%.

## Pre-doctoral work
- **Air Pollution and Road Safety**

    I link 6-hour air pollution exposure to the total number of car accidents in the city of Santiago by exploiting time-series variation from 2013 to 2016. In order to identify the causal effect of CO exposure, I use plausible exogenous variation in atmospheric stability to instrument CO exposure. I found a nonlinear relationship between CO exposure and the total number of car accidents. This result is driven by nonfatal accidents. Indeed, I do not find any impact on fatal accidents. In addition, the results hold under a battery of robustness checks. Although Santiago’s CO level is far below the international criteria of a hazardous level, I argue that reducing the average level of pollution leads to a sizable increase in social welfare due to a reduction in the number of car accidents.
