Hi, welcome to my website!

My name is Pablo Valenzuela-Casasempere (he/him) and I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at the [Vancouver School of Economics](https://economics.ubc.ca/). My main research interest is urban economics. In particular, I am interested on how urban topics interact with economic history, labor economics, and spatial economics. Before joining UBC, I completed a BA and MA in economics at the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile. 
<br /> You can find more about me in my [CV](files/cv_pablo_march23.pdf).
