Hi, welcome to my website!

My name is Pablo Valenzuela-Casasempere (he/him) and I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at the [Vancouver School of Economics](https://economics.ubc.ca/). 
I am an urban economist with interests in history, industrialization, and labor economics. 
I am also affiliated to [The Industrial Policy Group](https://www.industrialpolicygroup.com), an empirical research lab that aims to deliver empirical research about industrial policy.
Before joining UBC, I completed a BA and MA in economics at the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile. 

I was the recipient of the [2024 Sokoloff Dissertation Fellowship](https://eh.net/grants-fellowships/), a recognition awarded by the [Economic History Association](https://eh.net).

<br /> You can find more about me in my [CV](files/cv_pablo_march24.pdf).
